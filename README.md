CameraPulse is a security monitoring system that leverages computer vision to ensure vigilance by detecting the presence of a person, the use of a phone, and camera tampering. It generates alerts based on defined conditions and stores them in a local database. Another script processes these alerts, uploads images to an FTP server, and sends data to an API.

## üìú Features

- **Person Detection**: Alerts if no person is detected in the camera for `x` seconds.
- **Phone Detection**: Alerts if a phone is detected for more than `y` seconds.
- **Camera Tampering Detection**: Alerts if the camera is tampered with.
- **Local Database Storage**: Stores all alerts in a local database.
- **FTP Upload**: Uploads images stored locally to an FTP server.
- **API Integration**: Sends the data from the database to an API.
